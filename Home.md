Welcome to the RIALTO wiki!

## What is this space?
This is a space for confirmed technical documentation and specification for building out the RIALTO system.

## What is RIALTO?
It is a scholarship & research output and impact data aggregator and dashboard for the campus to use. 

It is a multi-phase project with this first phase focused on data aggregation, normalization, enhancements, and publication (either for programmatic use or a web UI). Later phases may look into more web UI reports and visualizations, faculty or entity profiles, a data aggregation pipeline administrative interface, and adding new or enhanced data sources.

Technically, this is a data aggregation system leveraging a data ETL pipeline, a canonical datastore system based on a triplestore with VIVO-ISF RDF, and a simple web application serving up basic search and view functionalities of that data.

Depends on modelsâ€¦ (and need for extension)
Yes, if only to work with VIVO (requirement from management)

## What is now RIALTO?
* At least in the short-term, a SDR researcher / depositor analytics dashboard. 
* An SDR Authorities management space. This will be a different system influenced by this work.
* At least in the short to mid-term, a faculty research profiles web application.
