This document describes how we load data into Vitro using Jena SPARQL Update (ARQ).

1. What is the http endpoint for Jena? Is it available to us?
2. Can we use curl, or do we need to use the ARQ tools (e.g. https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/sparql-remote.html#from-the-command-line)
3. Can we do SPARQL `LOAD FILE`?
4. If we can't do that, use the Java API for Jena: https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/update.html
