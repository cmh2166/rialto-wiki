RIALTO is primarily interested in **Works** (articles, research output, publications, etc.), **Agents** (people, departments, agencies, organizations, etc.), **Grants**, and **Projects**. Each of these is represented by a data model that defines the scope of the entity and a metadata application profile that shows what information we capture about these entities for RIALTO's usage.

## Works (via Citations)

Works are publications of articles, research outputs, datasets, etc. Citation for a Work is the main reference point / datapoint. If feasible, the citation should link to manifestations of that Work (i.e. DOI).

* **Types**: Publication, Research Output, Articles, Dataset, â€¦ 
* **Sources**: Web of Science, SUL-PUB (should be subset of what is in WoS)
