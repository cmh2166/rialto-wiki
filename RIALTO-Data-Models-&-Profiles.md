RIALTO is primarily interested in **Works** (articles, research output, publications, etc.), **Agents** (people, departments, agencies, organizations, etc.), **Grants**, and **Projects**. Each of these is represented by a data model that defines the scope of the entity and a metadata application profile that shows what information we capture about these entities for RIALTO's usage.

## Works (via Citations)

Works are publications of articles, research outputs, datasets, etc. Citation for a Work is the main reference point / datapoint. If feasible, the citation should link to manifestations of that Work (i.e. DOI).

* **Types**: Publication, Research Output, Articles, Dataset, â€¦ 
* **Sources**: Web of Science, SUL-PUB (should be subset of what is in WoS)

Field | Predicate | Expected Data Type | Cardinality | Value Type | Definition
----- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----------

* subject heading information in publications
* topic area of research / work
* date of publication / release / create
* author
* publisher

* which publications resulted from which grants

## Agents

Agents are some sort of actor involved in creating works or projects, or in supporting works or projects via grants or institutional support. 

* **Types**: People, Academic institutes, Departments, Universities, Colleges, Organizations / Agencies >> Funders
* **Sources**: Stanford LDAP, CAP Profiles API (Stanford Affiliates scholarly record type info), ORCID & ISNI.

* related topic areas
* role(s) / job(s)

## Grants

Grants are awards for some project(s) or work(s), usually attached to one or more lead agents (PIs) whether people or departments, and awarded or funded by an organization or agency.

* **Types**: Governmental << Federal / State / Local, Private, Internal to Stanford, ... 
* **Sources**: Web of Science (funding agency string / grant number in metadata), SERA (not done yet)

Field | Predicate | Expected Data Type | Cardinality | Value Type | Definition
----- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----------

* which publications resulted from which grants

## Projects

Projects here are research projects that are funded by grants or institutions, worked on by agents, and may produce multiple works. 
Sources: SERA (not done yet)
