To rebuild the Vitro index, click the "Rebuild Search Index" link in the admin UI or hit it via https://rialto-vitro-dev.stanford.edu/vitro/SearchIndex?rebuild=1, but note that you can't just curl that URL because 1) you will be challenged by Shibboleth first, and then 2) you need to be logged in to Vitro.
