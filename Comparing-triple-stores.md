TDB is a storage component of Apache Jena. It is one options for the persistence layer of Vitro. It's major shortcoming is that it can only be accessed by a single JVM or corruption of the data will occur. Since Vitro would run Jena with TDB in it's JVM, this means we cannot load data into the same TDB backed store from a second JVM while Vitro is running.  TDB has no external (network) APIs that we can leverage. TDB works best as the datastore for a standalone application not as a component in a system.

Fuseki is a SPARQL server that could be backed by TDB.  This would be one way to share a single TDB datastore with multiple applications.  Fuseki would provide (network) APIs that support multiple consumers at once. However Fuseki+TDB doesn't  provide for horizontal scale with update.

Blazegraph is a standalone triple store with several external (network) APIs that support multiple consumers at once. It is know for being among the fastest triple stores with an available GPU accelerator. It can support big-data scale data sets. Blazegraph was acqui-hired by Amazon in 2016 and the developers of Blazegraph went on to produce Apache Neptune.  Blazegraph is still available for download but development on it has been at a virtual standstill. The Wikimedia foundation selected Blazegraph for their wikidata query service.
