The RIALTO Entity Resolver is an ECS service that exposes a RESTful HTTP API for querying the canonical data store for known entity types. If an entity is found, a URI is returned. Else, nothing is returned.

[See the resolver README for more](https://github.com/sul-dlss-labs/rialto-entity-resolver).
