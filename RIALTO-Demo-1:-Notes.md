* RIALTO in a nutshell (what's the point?)
  * Will take info from inception desk and similar spots
* Introducing the RIALTO team and our roles
* What we've been working on
  * Sprint 0: recap the technology review (architecture, tech options, early challenges, etc.)
  * Frame the perf. assessment: why we are doing it at this point, and what are the goals?
     * We are doing a performance assessment since one of our requirements is to load a large amount of data into the system and keep it up to date on a regular basis. We would like to understand how the various mechanisms for bulk loading data into Vitro compare and if there are options or features we can enable/disable to make data loading more efficient.
  * Performance assessment status report: https://github.com/sul-dlss/rialto/wiki/Performance-Assessment 
  * All work happening in the open (links to wiki, waffle, etc.)
* What's next
  * Completing performance assessment and beginning to build out the architecture in earnest
